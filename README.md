# Competitive Programming solutions

This is a simple repository containing solutions to the problems I upsolved mostly on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), but also on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/), ICPC contests, Open Cup, etc. The problems are chosen rather randomly but are mostly compliant with my mood at that moment. Although the repository was created for personal reference, I would not deny any outer access. Always glad to be of help, even if it's abysmally small!   

The Codeforces solutions are named accordingly: '_The contest number_ **Problem's rank within the contest**'.file-extension (_1255_**E**.cpp)  
Finding the corresponding problem statement: https:codeforces.com/contest/'_The contest number_'/**Problem rank**  

The problems are ranked according to their difficuly with problem A being the easiest one.

#### Problem statement retreival format's for other websites are to be added_
