# Competitive Programming solutions

This is a simple repository containing solutions to the problems I upsolved mostly on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), but also on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/), ICPC contests, Open Cup, etc. The problems are chosen rather randomly but are mostly compliant with my mood at that moment.

The Codeforces solutions are named accordingly: '_The contest number_ **Problem's rank within the contest**'.file-extension (_1157_**F**.cpp)  
Finding the corresponding problem statement: _https:codeforces.com/contest/'_The contest number_'/**Problem rank**_  
For example: _https:codeforces.com/contest/1157/problem/F_
